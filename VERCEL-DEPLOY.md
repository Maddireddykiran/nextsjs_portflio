## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account
- Node.js 20+ installed locally
- Git

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push your code to a Git repository

Make sure your project is in a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

### 2. Import your project in Vercel

1. Log in to your Vercel account
2. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
3. Select your Git repository
4. Configure the project with the following settings:

### 3. Configure Build Settings

- **Framework Preset**: `Remix`
- **Build Command**: `npm run vercel-build`
- **Output Directory**: `build/client`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`

### 4. Environment Variables

```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the build logs in the Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
3. Verify that your `vercel.json` configuration is correct
4. Make sure your Remix version is compatible with Vercel

### Common Issues

#### Build fails due to Node.js version

Vercel uses Node.js 18 by default. This project requires Node.js 20+. Add the following in your `package.json`:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": ">=20.10.0"
}
```

#### CSS or asset loading issues

Make sure your assets are properly handled by Remix. Check the `vite.config.js` file and ensure the assets are being properly processed.

## Local Testing

To test your Vercel deployment locally:

1. Install the Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run `vercel dev` in your project directory
