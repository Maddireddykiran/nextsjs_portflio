## Introduction to LiveCycle ES2 Sample Application

In this tutorial sequence, we will create processes for an enterprise/organization to automate the form design workflows. Workflow involves Designers designing forms; QA testing forms; and Form Requesters approving them. This sample application can act as an infrastructure at an enterprise setting with slight modifications to the configuration settings for the services in the application.

Today, in this short screencast, I will briefly explain the use cases, workflows/processes, tools we employ, and services we use to build the processes. I will follow up this blog with other screencasts explaining in detail about each service used in the application.

## Key Components and Workflows

### Components

1. **Designer Interface** - For creating and editing form designs
2. **QA Testing Module** - For validating form functionality
3. **Approval Workflow** - For Form Requesters to review and approve designs

### Workflow Process

The automated workflow consists of several stages:

1. A designer creates or modifies a form using the Designer interface
2. The form is submitted for QA testing
3. QA testers verify form functionality and behavior
4. If issues are found, the form is returned to the designer
5. Once QA approved, the form is sent to Form Requesters
6. Form Requesters can approve or request changes
7. Upon final approval, the form is deployed to production

## Configuration and Implementation

To implement this system in your enterprise, you'll need to:

- Configure the appropriate services in your LiveCycle ES2 environment
- Adapt the workflow to match your organization's approval process
- Set up user roles and permissions for Designers, QA testers, and Form Requesters
- Integrate with your existing form storage and management systems

In the upcoming tutorials, I'll dive deeper into each service and configuration option to help you implement this solution effectively for your organization.

Stay tuned for more detailed instructions on implementing this workflow system in your enterprise environment.
